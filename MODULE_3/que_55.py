# What is lambda function in python? What we call a function which is
# incomplete version of a function? 

# A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. Lambda functions are also known as "anonymous functions" because they do not have a name like regular functions defined using the def keyword.
